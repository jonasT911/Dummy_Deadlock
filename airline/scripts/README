Before you start an experiment, you should complete steps 1 and 2:

1. Set the environment variable experiment_root to point to the parent 
directory of the subject directory by typing
"setenv experiment_root <path>"

   For example, assume you have a subject directory "airline" and you 
locate it under /cs_machine/exp_group/experiments, then you would set 
experiment_root by executing the command:

        setenv experiment_root /cs_machine/exp_group/experiments

2. If you plan to model check the airline example using 
Java PathFinder (JPF), set the environment variable jpf_root to point
to the root directory of the JPF installation.

   For example, assuming you have installed JPF  at
/usr/tools/javapathfinder, then you would set jpf_root by executing
the command:

        setenv jpf_root /usr/tools/javapathfinder

Notes
1. The version of JPF against which this example was tested requires
the use of JDK Version 1.6.
2. The runJPF shell script can be modified to use the expect tool to limit
the amount of time JPF will spend searching the state space. This is useful
for programs with a large statespace. Refer to the runJPF.sh script for
details (shown in the random run sections).
