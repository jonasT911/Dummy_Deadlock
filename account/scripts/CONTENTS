    - runJPF.sh

1. install.sh <application directory>

   <application directory> : orig

   Example:

   %install.sh orig


   Tasks done by this script:

       - Removes all previous files in ~/source directory

       - Removes all previous files in ~/outputs directory

       - Copies Java source files to ~/source directory

       - Compiles the Java source files

2. runJPF.sh <application directory> <search type> <number of runs>

   <application directory> : orig

   <search type> : defaut or random

   <number of runs> : (optional - ignored unless a random search order
                      is specified) the number of times JPF is invoked;
                      default is 1

   Example:

   %runJPF.sh orig random 10

   Tasks done by this script:

       - Runs the Java PathFinder model checker on the code in the 'orig'
         directory structure 10 times using the random search order
       - Generates a new seed for each run of JPF. 
       - Names the resulting log file using the generated seed.

   Example:

   %runJPF.sh orig default

   Tasks done by this script:

       - Runs the Java PathFinder model checker on the code in the 'orig'
         directory structure using the default search order
